        <h2> My Background</h2>
        <p> Prior to entering Epicodus I was working full-time and was recently out of High School. I was attending Century High School and graduated in 2022! Ive been working for almost two year now and have had a handful of jobs such as a Starbucks Barista, Warehouse Worker, and Currently working at Goodwill. I decided to enroll in this program to better my life style and to achieve the American Dream as a first generation Mexican-American. It means everything to succeed and to have a well paying job and the overall goal is to have a nice and steady life style. </p>
